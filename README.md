# Co-Lab Flask Workshop

Welcome to the Co-Lab Flask workshop! In this course we will be going through a step by step tutorial for building a data driven Flask application. The only 
prerequisites are knowledge of HTML and some basic Python programming. In the end we hope to provide you with some useful basics of web application development, workflows, and some starter code to help you get your project running. We love Python and Flask here at the Co-Lab because its practical, fast, and easy to use for diverse projects, and we hope you'll find it that way, too!

The application that we will be building is a simple library inventory manager. The design patterns we will be using to build the application will be generalizable to any application that you want to build, as we will be focusing on the connection and separation between the backend and frontend of the app. Hopefully, you will be able to use the framework and the starter code (or structure) that we learn today and use it to build your own applications with your own data and logic.
